    "Selection process discription2": "Raqamyah places large emphasis on listing pre-qualified SMEs on the platform. To be considered for finance, the financee (debtor) must meet certain criteria such as length of business, sector, revenue threshold, and level of debt.

The interview serves another purpose as well: we do an assessment of the management qualities and relevant experience of the management. 10% of the credit score is based on the management qualities of the applicant and its team.    Once the visit is completed, the scoring is done based on financial (quantitative) and non-financial (qualitative) information. This adds up to several financial indicators, such as operating efficiency, profitability, cash flow, liquidity, leverage, etc., that go back three years in time and the current year. This way, the scoring model shows the development of these financial indicators and gives insight in the financial performance. The financial performance of the applicant makes up for 50% of the credit score.",

Obviously, when the market outlook is negative, it also has a negative effect on the score.

Data points are analysed, verified and finally scored with an overall risk weighting.

If the applicant is not fundable, the funding request will be rejected, and it will not be presented to the financers. If a funding request is within acceptable risk band for Raqamyah, our scoring model will show what the credit score will be. The credit score ranges from 0 to 10 points. To make the score more easily readable, we convert this score to the categories you know: A+ to C. The profit rate is determined by the number of points attained and the duration of finance request.

Through the Raqamyah Supply Chain Program, the factory (supplier) will instantly receive the value of the goods from Raqamyah when they are invoiced, while the distributor (buyer) will benefit from more flexible and easier payment terms."
